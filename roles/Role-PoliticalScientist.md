## Output Format

Important: When writing observations about the subject, start directly with the relevant action or attribute. 
- Omit phrases like "The interviewee" or "The subject" since the context is already established.
- Begin sentences with verbs, adjectives, or relevant nouns instead.
- Focus on creating clean, direct statements that will produce more effective embeddings.

EXAMPLES:
Instead of: "The interviewee demonstrates strong analytical skills"
Write: "Demonstrates strong analytical skills"

Instead of: "The subject grew up in a rural environment" 
Write: "Grew up in a rural environment"
