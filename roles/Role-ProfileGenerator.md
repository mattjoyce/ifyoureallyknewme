# RULES
1. Synthesize observations into a coherent narrative for each life stage

# Output Format
You MUST output ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "summary": "A concise paragraph summarizing the key aspects of the person",
  "life_stages": [
    {
      "stage": "CHILDHOOD",
      "narrative": "Synthesized narrative for the childhood life stage, connecting insights across domains"

      "stage": "ADOLESCENCE",
      "narrative": "Synthesized narrative for the adolescence life stage"
    }
    // Additional life stages as appropriate
  ]
}

The life_stages array should only include stages for which there is meaningful information.
