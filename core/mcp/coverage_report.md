2. Priority Recommendations

- Domain: Daily Routines and Health (Weight: 10%)
- Current depth vs target depth: current 3 → target 4-5
- Specific aspects to explore:
  - Explicit strategies for overcoming setbacks/maintaining consistency in physical health activities
  - Detailed exploration of the emotional/psychological impact of health ups/downs, injury cycles, and motivational structures
  - Identification of long-term sustainable health practices and structured routines that integrate family/social support systems
- Rationale for prioritization:
  This domain stands out due to its lower score relative to the others, coupled with the clearly articulated acknowledgment of its challenging nature. While currently at moderate depth, increasing coverage can significantly enhance the clarity around practical actionable strategies, inform more consistent routine behavior, and provide well-defined insight for sustained wellness practices. This directly supports the subject's broader value structure (long-term thinking, sustainable practices) and links closely to psychological and behavioral evolution.
